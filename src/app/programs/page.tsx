                Utilizing a hands-on approach to learning, our school&#39;s curriculum offers our students daily challenges to explore and discover the world around them through problem solving and critical thinking. Each level, Nursery, Pre-K 3 and Pre-K 4 offer opportunities for practicing self-care, fine and gross motor skills, and physical well-being plus developing and fine-tuning language skills through poetry, song and stories. The curriculum is designed to develop self-confidence and self-awareness in preparation for the future. Lessons are presented individually, in small groups and whole groups by qualified teachers. Children are then allowed to continue working independently at their own rate. Subject matter is drawn from the learning standards: mathematics, reading, language arts, religion, science, social studies, music, art and more. Subjects are blended to present well-balanced lessons. Monthly themes lead the path of learning and material presentations. The school is well equipped with a multitude of educational materials. Whole group activities encourage social- emotional development through using communication skills to interact with peers, following directions and so much more.

              S.T.E.A.M. (is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) gives a new name to what we at Holy Family Day Nursery School have been doing for many yearsâ¦ helping children to explore, observe, ask questions, predict, problem-solve, by integrating and applying their learning to real-life situations.
              <br /><br />
              Young children are great explorers. They learn through play and using various materials made available to them in our well-equipped classrooms. Allowing the younger students to explore, create and problem-solve helps develop their thinking skills for future application. Part of that creativity is expressed through art.
              <br /><br />
              The older students actively engage in cooperative group problem-solving through collaboration utilizing known and newly acquired means of communication.
              <br /><br />
              Our goal is to promote academic growth and development of critical thinking and reasoning skills in the hopes they will lead our students toward future S.T.E.A.M. studies.
              <br /><br />
              Becoming innovators, inventors, and problem-solvers will lead our students to 21st-century careers.

                All students newly enrolled at Holy Family Day Nursery School are encouraged to attend a minimum of two of the four weeks of the Summer Orientation Program. New students are welcome and encouraged to attend three or even all four weeks of the Summer Orientation Program. The Orientation Program is conducted during the month of August each year.
                <br /><br />
                The Summer Orientation Program is designed to assist new students with the adjustment period of beginning a new school and making new friendships. It is a fun-filled introduction to the routine of the school. The outdoor environment plays a great part in this program. Teachers are encouraged to incorporate the outdoors into their daily curriculum. Picnic lunches, outdoor science exploration and playing are all exciting experiences.
                <br /><br />
                The Summer Program curriculum is based on a specially prepared theme. Each class develops unique studies into the chosen theme. The students spend more time enjoying constructing arts and craft projects, participating in music and movement activities contributing to language development, building social skills while developing new friendships.
                <br /><br />
                This is a wonderful opportunity for adjustment for both children starting out in their education and for transfer students to get to learn about their new school, the staff, and the Franciscan Sisters of St. Elizabeth who conduct the school.
                <br /><br />
                The hours of operation for the Summer Program are the same as the regular academic year (7:00 AM â 5:30 PM) while the daily classroom schedules are often adapted to the specific studies and activities at hand. Summer Program dates and information are included in the initial registration packets for students registering prior to the beginning of each new school year.
                <br /><br />
                The Summer Program is open to new and present students plus those Pre-K 4 students who have graduated from Holy Family Day Nursery School and are moving on to new schools for Kindergarten.
